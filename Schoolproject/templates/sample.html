    <h2 class="text-center">Welcome to Trividha school</h2>
    <p class="page-content-founder x11" style="color: blue"><em><b>Trividha Smart School one of the best school. Which is situated at
        Beside PG
        Center, Nuzvid ,Krishna. It caters to the long awaited needs of the student community for a wholesome education
        and
        emphasizes non-academic activities. Its roots are embedded in Indian culture and ethos.It has created a new crop
        of
        talented young professionals every year. It provides a uniquely broad and interdisciplinary technical education.
        This school gives weightage to other activities which is a vital for a successful career life.
        As someone who has spent over half of her life as a student, I can vouch for the importance of school. While new
        school years are often met with groans and complaints, it is our civic duty as parents and human beings, to
        educate our children, not to mention ourselves. School serves a number of purposes from building confidence to
        teaching children the importance of teamwork and working with others. School helps guide youngsters though the
        establishment of a daily routine, which is of utmost importance as we direct them toward the workplace, and as
        they become productive members of society. Students are provided with access to new ideas, including science and
        language, and are given the opportunity to learn more about world cultures, geography, and personal
        history.There are many types of schools available, ranging from private to public to homeschooling. Online
        academies and a number of public and private school programs offer Internet-based learning too. Whatever the
        choice, a person’s schooling is always more effective with positive reinforcement from parents or guardians. The
        Home-School Connection, a course by Steve Reifman, offers excellent advice and instruction to help parents and
        guardians work with together with teachers to guide students through many successful years of education.</b><br>

    <div class="container">
        <h5 style="color: #ff192f">Let’s take a look at why school is so important to children of all ages:</h5>
        <h3><u>1.Confidence:</u></h3>
        <p class="page-content-founder " style="color:green;">I thrived at this school and my confidence increased tenfold because I had
            access to
            classes, teachers,
            and administrators that supported my love of the arts, and gave me a community of fellow artists to have as
            a
            support system.
            This small community gave me a sense of belonging and a safe place to experiment and grow my skills as a
            visual
            artist,
            which in turn provided me with the confidence I needed to apply and eventually attend art school.

        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h3><u>2.Socialization</u></h3>
        <p class="page-content-founder " style="color: green">Humans are social animals and we need people around us to survive. School, yes
            even
            online school, can
            be an excellent way to build a network of friends and a like-minded community. I recently took an online
            course
            with an artist whose work I admire. Almost instantly, I was provided with an extensive online network of the
            instructor’s former students, who were available to offer advice and support regarding assignments and
            projects.
            Now, even months after taking the course, I’ve managed to maintain a connection with my instructor as well
            as a
            number of my fellow students. My graduate school experience also provided me with a number of friends that I
            currently work with and utilize when I’m putting together a new project. These connections and relationships
            can
            offer you guidance through the career landscape and offer help when you need a recommendation or job
            position or
            a shoulder to lean on. I’ve found that many of my friends from this period in my life have experienced
            similar
            struggles and successes, and their presence in my life has often helped me during difficult times in my
            career.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h3><u>3.Teamwork</u></h3>
        <p class="page-content-founder" style="color:green;">Friendships aren’t the only important relationships that can be built through
            school. A school environment offers students the opportunity to learn to work with others, which is a very
            important “real world” skill. Through games and projects, and even participation in after-school sports,
            children can learn the importance of forging relationships with each other. These activities can also help
            us
            learn to manage difficult personalities, find our way as leaders, and better understand the way we work as
            individuals.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h3><u>4.Inspiration</u></h3>
        <p class="page-content-founder0" style="color: green">I’ve found, as a writer and artist, that school has not only helped me develop
            lifelong friendships, work strategies, and career goals, but has also functioned as one of my primary means
            of
            inspiration. If I hit a patch of writer’s block, or artist’s block, I’ve found that taking a course can
            often
            reignite my passion for my craft. A year ago, I was completely lost in terms of my studio practice as an
            artist.
            I wasn’t making any work and I felt like maybe my time in fine arts was over. My husband suggested that I
            take a
            workshop that the local art school was offering, and within a month, I was drawing and painting again with
            the
            passion that I’d had when I first entered art school nearly 20 years ago. Even as someone who has worked as
            a
            professional educator, I never feel as though I know everything simply because I have a college degree.
            School
            benefits everyone, and it’s important to remember that everyone can better himself through learning.</p>
